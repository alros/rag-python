Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the three most probable diseases with a high degree 
of confidence. The patient's statement about feeling persecuted by people around them could be related to various 
physical or mental health conditions. Some possibilities include anxiety disorders, depression, paranoia, or even 
autoimmune diseases. However, without further information or examination, it would not be appropriate to assign specific 
probabilities to these or any other diseases. It is important for the patient to seek a thorough evaluation by a 
healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause of their symptoms and receive appropriate treatment.

It is important to note that feeling persecuted and hiding from people can be symptoms of various mental and physical 
health conditions. However, based on the provided information, here are three possible diseases with their degrees of 
confidence:

1. Schizophrenia - 70%
Symptoms such as paranoia, hearing voices, and withdrawing from social situations are common in schizophrenia. The 
patient's reported feelings of persecution and hiding from people for days suggest that this condition may be a 
possibility.

2. Agoraphobia - 50%
Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by fear and avoidance of places or situations that may cause panic or 
embarrassment. The patient's report of hiding in their apartment for days suggests that agoraphobia could be a 
possibility, but the feeling of persecution is less common in this condition.

3. Depression - 20%
While depression can cause feelings of isolation and withdrawal from social situations, it typically does not involve 
the level of paranoia or fear of persecution reported by the patient. Therefore, while it's still a possibility, the 
likelihood is lower compared to schizophrenia and agoraphobia.\n\nIt's important to note that this analysis is based on 
limited information provided by the patient, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made through a thorough medical 
evaluation and consultation with a healthcare professional.

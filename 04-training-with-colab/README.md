# Training with Colab

A notebook for Google Colab to produce a fine-tuned model. It uses quantization to limit the amount of resources.

## Configuration

Set `model_name` to `LLAMA` or `GPT`

Set `samples` to a value between `1000` and `10000`: please note that beyond `5000` the risk of disconnection is very high.
